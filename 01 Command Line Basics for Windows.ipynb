    "WHAT IS THE COMMAND LINE?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The command line is an integral tool for making the jump from beginners programming to a more compentent and efficient level. Essentially it is a way to skip the use of GUIs (graphical user interfaces) and talk to the computer directly using text commands (essentially this is what is going on in the background when you click on things in the GUI). A great example of this is navigating to a folder on your desktop. In a graphical interface, the desktop is usually the first screen you will see after the login. With the mouse you then hover over the file you want and double click the mouse or keypad. In the command line you can do exactly the same thing just by typing a command like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "cd desktop/*name of folder*\n",
    "\n",
    " - This means \"change directory to the desktop and then change again to the folder\n",
    " \n",
    "* In this example, the time saved typing instead of clicking is minimal, but for larger more complex tasks, the command line can be an essential tool to help speed up the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The command line is also used to interact with programs and programming languages. Python scripts are normally run directly in the command line window. The command line also allows you quickly to download thing you may need to help with coding such as Python Packages or tools to handle tasks that can be automated in the background."
