    "\n",
    "* Git is a version control system (VCS) but what does that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "    When working on large projects or with multiple developers its very difficult to keep track of what is going on with everything. A Version control system allows you to make copies of the project (branches) to work on independently, push these changes to the project, check if these changes are correct, revert back to earlier versions of the code if it is needed and so on. This makes it far easier to coordinate work and see who is doing what.\n",

    "What is GitHub?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Github is an online Git Repository, aka. its an website version of Git, which makes it easy for everyone to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can you do with Github?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Track your code history (when changes where made and by whom)\n",
    "* Use 'commits' to create code history by logging/saving the way the code is at the exact point the commit is made.\n",
    "* Revert to one of these 'commits' at any point (in case you screw up)\n",
    "* Check if changes should be made/ added to the code before it is 'pushed' to the code\n"

    "USING GIT/ GITHUB\n",
    "\n",
    "Initializing a Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create a folder for your project\n",
    "2) Open the command line tool\n",
    "3) Navigate to your project folder\n",
    "4) use the command\n",
    "\n",
    "git init\n",
    "\n",
    " - This will initialize a github repo in the folder. Essentially its a bunch of files in a 'hidden' .git folder within the project, that tells the computer 'treat this folder and iits contents as a Git repository (that simple!)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Now you can use git commands in the folder.\n",
    "6) add your name and email to the config folder (so people know the project is yours!) with the following commands\n",
    "\n",
    "git config --global user.name 'John Smith'\n",
    "git config --global user.email '420_terrible_email_name.aol.com'\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Create whatever files you want and add them to the staging area by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "git add *name of file*\n",
    "\n",
    "- or add all files at once with:\n",
    "\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "\n",
    "8) If you need to remove a file from the staging area, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "git rm --cached *name of file*\n",
    "\n",
    "9) To see what is in the staging area, waiting to be pushed to the repository, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "git status\n",
    "\n",
    "10) To commit to the repo use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "git commit\n",
    "\n",
    " - This will open up either a VIM editor or default code editing software and you will need to write a comment about the commit ie. 'Changed the css', then close the editor and the commit should run automatically\n",
    " \n",
    "11) To skip opening the editor (probably best!) simply type\n",
    "\n",
    "git commit -m *'comment here in parentheses*\n",
    "\n",
    "12) YOu will want to add a .gitignore file to make sure you don't add files with sensitive data to the git (ie. keys, authorization codes etc). Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "touch .gitignore\n",
    " \n",
    " - Or simply create it using an editor\n",
    " \n",
    "13) To add files to the .gitignore list (the files you don't want in the repo) simply add the file name to the gitignore file in a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    " - to add an enitre directory (folder), type /*folder name*\n",
    " \n",
    "14) To create a branch (you don't want to be editing the main code base, so you create 'branches' which can then be added to the main code base later) use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "git branch *name of branch*\n",
    "\n",
    " - The main branch is called the 'Master' branch. Using the status command will tell you which branch you are currently working on\n",
    " \n",
    "15) Like before add it and commit it. To switch branches use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "git checkout *name of branch*\n",
    "\n",
    "16) In the master branch you can 'merge a branch into the master branch (bring all the changes made into the master branch) using the command\n",
    "\n",
    "git merge *name of branch*\n",
    "\n",
    " - Again, this will ask for a comment in your code editor\n",
    "\n",
    "REMOTE WORK\n",
    "\n",
    "17) To start a remote repository, go to Github (sign up if you haven't already)\n",
    "\n",
    "18) Go to your home page and click the green button to create a new repository\n",
    "\n",
    "19) You can initialize the repo with a 'readme' file. This will add a file to the remote repo that translates to notes underneath the project. It is useful for describing the repo if other people are going to using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "20) To link this repository to your local repo use the command\n",
    "\n",
    "git remote add origin *https address of your repository*\n",
    "\n",
    "21) And to push your local code to the remote repo use:\n",
    "\n",
    "git push -u origin master\n",
    "\n",
    " - IF you have initialized a readme file in the remote repo often you will get an error when pushing. THe easiest fixed is to copy your readme file into your local repository, and then use\n",
    " \n",
    "git push -f origin master\n",
    "\n",
    " - this will then force the overwrite of the remote repo files (thus losing your readme.md file so copy it first!)\n",
